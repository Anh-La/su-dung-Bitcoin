# Using Bitcoin:
Bitcoin's diverse advantages range from financial security and economic opportunities to technological advancements and future trends. As the Bitcoin network continues to evolve, its transition from a block-reward-driven security model to a fee-based one remains a critical aspect of its long-term sustainability. Layering solutions like the Lightning Network will help scale Bitcoin for smaller transactions, while the base layer will focus on high-value settlements, ensuring Bitcoin's role as a valuable and secure digital asset in the evolving financial landscape.

## 3. Security and Network Stability

### 3.1. Transition from Block Rewards to Transaction Fees
- **Description:** Bitcoin is transitioning from a block-reward-driven security model to a fee-based one. This transition poses potential security risks but is manageable if the network can sustain a healthy fee market.
- **Example:** Currently, miners are rewarded with newly generated bitcoins. As of 2021, the reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block, but as the reward decreases, transaction fees must increase to maintain the same level of security.
- **Source:** Lyn Alden, [Bitcoin: Fee-Based Security Modeling](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-security-modeling/)

### 3.2. Security Through Economic Incentives
- **Description:** Bitcoin’s security relies on economic incentives. The high cost of mining and maintaining a 51% attack is a deterrent, ensuring that miners are incentivized to maintain network integrity rather than disrupt it.
- **Example:** A state actor attempting a 51% attack would face significant costs in terms of acquiring hardware and electricity, making such an attack impractical.
- **Source:** Lyn Alden, [Bitcoin: Fee-Based Security Modeling](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-security-modeling/)

### 3.3. Developing a Fee Market
- **Description:** To ensure security in the long term, Bitcoin must develop a sustainable fee market. Fees are expected to play an increasingly critical role as block rewards diminish over time.
- **Example:** In 2021, the annualized fee spend rate was approximately $1.85 billion, representing about 0.25% of Bitcoin's market capitalization. As adoption grows, fee-based security will become more important.
- **Source:** Lyn Alden, [Bitcoin: Fee-Based Security Modeling](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-security-modeling/)

### 3.4. The Risk of Low Transaction Volume
- **Description:** If Bitcoin experiences low transaction volume on its base layer, it could struggle to maintain security as fees would not be sufficient to deter attacks.
- **Example:** If fewer users are willing to pay fees for on-chain transactions, Bitcoin could face security challenges, especially as the block reward continues to decrease.
- **Source:** Lyn Alden, [Bitcoin: Fee-Based Security Modeling](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-security-modeling/)

### 3.5. Economic Viability of Long-Term Security
- **Description:** For Bitcoin to remain secure in the long term, fees must be sufficient to cover the costs of maintaining the network’s security. This requires broad adoption and continued use of the base layer for significant transactions.
- **Example:** If the average transaction fee is $20, Bitcoin could generate over $2 billion annually in fees, ensuring long-term security for the network.

### 4.3. High-Value Settlement
- **Description:** The Bitcoin network allows secure transfer of high value with low fees, serving as the ultimate payment method for large transactions.
- **Source:** Lyn Alden, [Bitcoin: Fee-Based Security Modeling](https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-security-modeling/)

### 4.4. Layering Solutions for Scalability
- **Description:** Bitcoin’s base layer is designed for high-value settlements, while smaller transactions are expected to occur on secondary layers like the Lightning Network, which allow for faster, low-cost transactions.
- **Example:** The Lightning Network enables users to make small transactions off-chain, improving scalability while keeping fees manageable for large-scale transactions on the base layer.
